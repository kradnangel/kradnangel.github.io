#### Level 3. Follow up

Based on level 2, you can follow up -- add some restriction to your question or try to improve your solution (in time complexity and space complexity) by changing some part in your code or even coming up with a new method.

#### Level 4. Learn and compare

Based on level 3, you should read the methods others used  so that you can know more and even better methods that can be used to solve this questions. Also, you can compare methods with each other to learn how to analysis and compare algorithms in different questions.
