Today I went to see the doctor. Oh, no. See the nurse. It's a little strange that the nurse is responsible for see a patient and the doctor is responsible for registration for patient, which is in contrast to what the doctors and nurses do in my country.
It seems that it's not difficult to see the doctor by myself. Of course, I need to look up the words I want to say first.
