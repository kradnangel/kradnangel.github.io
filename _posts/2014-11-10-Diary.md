Tonight is a hardworking night. Study for around 6 hours to work out the document of my project. But I need to work out my new SOP tomorrow since the deadline of application is approaching.

The day after tomorrow is the last chance to take the GRE test. I don't know how many scores I can get. But I will try my best! The best feedback is over 150. Let's rock.

Today, I find a excellent app for reciting the GRE words. But, just two days left for me to fight for GRE test. It is much to be regretted that we could not meet earlier.

App: "再要你命三千"

Today I went to see the doctor. Oh, no. See the nurse. It's a little strange that the nurse is responsible for see a patient and the doctor is responsible for registration for patient, which is in contrast to what the doctors and nurses do in my country.
It seems that it's not difficult to see the doctor by myself. Of course, I need to look up the words I want to say first.
