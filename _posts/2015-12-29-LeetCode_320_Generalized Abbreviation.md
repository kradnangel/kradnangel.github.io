### [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/generalized-abbreviation/)
Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word.

Example:
Given word = "word", return the following list (order does not matter):

	["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]

### Solution
Recursively enumerate every letter. There are two cases for one letter -- itself or '1'. 

All abbreviations of 'word' are generated by combining 'w'/'1' with the all abbreviations of 'ord'. Then recursively generate 'ord'.

When backtracking, if '1' meets an abbreviation starting with number, make the number plus one.

e.g.:

	'1' + '1rd' = '2rd'

           
notice that the number could be larger than '9'. So, we shouldn't only check the first character of the abbreviation. 

e.g.:

	'1' + '10s' = '11s'
