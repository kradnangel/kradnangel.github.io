###[Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
    For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},

    A solution set is:
    (-1, 0, 1)
    (-1, -1, 2)
	
### Solution
Enumrate the first element from position 0 to n-3.

Use two pointers to point the second and third numbers separately. The start positions of second and third numbers are the position of first element plus one and the last position in list.

Calculate the sum, if sum is samller than 0, move the pointer of second number right. If sum is larger than 0, move the pointer of third number left. If sum equals to 0, record the three numbers and move the two pointers at the same time.

Hint: When move pointer, if the next value equals the current value, move pointer again so that we can get distinct answers.
